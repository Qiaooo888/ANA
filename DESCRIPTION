Description: A comprehensive R package for exploratory data analysis and 
    visualization. Provides three main functions: ana() for basic statistical 
    analysis with automatic variable type detection and summary statistics, 
    alook() for enhanced visualization including distribution plots and missing 
    value analysis, and avar() for batch analysis of all variables with detailed 
    type classification and data quality assessment. The package automatically 
    handles various data types including numeric, factor, logical, character, 
    date, and special values, with robust error handling and user-friendly 
    Chinese output.
